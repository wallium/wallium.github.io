Things I should/fix do when I have time:

Find out why the navbar button to scroll to the resume/contact causes the height of the main
background picture to momentarily be really large. (I think has something to do with 
the call to the height of the projects container, but I don't know why)

Implement navbar button active classes and have them change when I scroll through.
Also style the navbar more.

Pick better fonts and colors... LOL

Figure out why the projects carousel is a little choppy and fix it.

After making changes to the style, clean up style.css and get rid of redundancies

Replace some ng-repeat div content with directives
